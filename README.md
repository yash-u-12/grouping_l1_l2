## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Matches developer interns and tech leads by their **college affiliation**.
- Groups developers into teams of 5 per group, assigning up to 5 groups (25 developers) per tech lead.
- Assigns leftover developers randomly to tech leads with capacity.
- Tracks developer intern **Active/Inactive status** that tech leads can update.
- Provides a dashboard summary for each tech lead showing counts of active vs inactive interns.
- Generates lists of unassigned developers and tech leads (if any).
- Provides an easy **Streamlit web app** to look up tech leads and their assigned groups by email.
- Tech leads can toggle intern status in real-time, and the statuses are saved persistently.
